                    I am motivated by curiosity and the drive to build things that <br /> 
                    matter. Whether itâ€™s Artificial Intelligence, Web Dev, or data <br />
                    analytics, I see each project as an opportunity to learn and gain <br /> 
                    confidance to reach out of the box and learn further. My journey in <br /> 
                    Computer Science is not just about obtaining knowledge, but about <br /> 
                    creating solutions that are impactful on a day-to-day basis. This <br />
